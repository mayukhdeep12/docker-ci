# To use this workflow:
# 1. Set up GitHub Secrets for DOCKERHUB_USERNAME and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
# 2. Ensure app.js, app.test.js, package.json, and Dockerfile are in your repository
# 3. Place this file in .github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml
# 4. Push to the main branch to trigger the workflow
# 5. Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions to verify the build, test, and push steps
